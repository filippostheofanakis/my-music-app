# My Music App

My Music App is a full-stack application designed for music enthusiasts. It enables users to listen to a selection of songs, manage playlists, and utilize advanced music features. This project leverages a React.js frontend and a Node.js/Express backend, integrating PostgreSQL for database management and Firebase for robust authentication mechanisms.

## Features

- User Authentication: Secure login functionality with Google or custom username/password.
- Music Playback: Users can browse and play a variety of songs through an intuitive interface.
- Playlist Management: Enables users to create, edit, and manage personalized music playlists. This       feature is planned for future release.
- YouTube to MP3 Conversion: Users can paste a YouTube URL, and the app converts the video to MP3         audio, storing it in the database for later playback. This feature is implemented for educational       purposes and training, adhering to the concept of fair use and not intended to circumvent YouTube's     usage policies.
- Responsive Design: A clean, user-friendly interface accessible on various devices, ensuring a           seamless user experience across platforms.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: Firebase Authentication
- Additional Libraries: axios for HTTP requests, bcrypt for password hashing, jsonwebtoken for managing   JWTs, and specific libraries for converting YouTube videos to MP3 format as part of the learning        process.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the frontend directory, install dependencies using `npm install`, and start the app with `npm start`.
3. For the backend, navigate to the backend directory, install dependencies, and start the server.
4. Ensure PostgreSQL is set up with the required database and tables.
